VoxForge & Julius Quick Start - Julian Grammar

The enclosed sample grammar files are for demonstration purposes only.  They allow the Julius speech recognition engine to recognize the following type of sentences (and many more):

 * CALL STEVE YOUNG
 * DIAL FIVE SEVEN EIGHT TWO
 * DIAL THREE ZERO 
 * DIAL TWO TWO FOUR FOUR NINE ZERO SEVEN SEVEN 
 * PHONE JOE YOUNG JOHNSTON JOHNSTON JOHNSTON STEVE STEVE STEVE JOE 
 * CALL BOB JORDAN
 * CALL STEVE
 * CALL STEVE JOHNSTON
 * PHONE STEVE 
 * DIAL OH OH FOUR FIVE SIX 

Basically, the grammar is designed to recognize any combination of the numbers 1 through 9, ZERO and OH.  You must precede numbers with the word 'DIAL' - as in "dial 1 2 3".  It is also set up to recognize any combination of the following names: STEVE, YOUNG, BOB, JOHNSTON, JOHN, JORDAN, and JOE.  You must precede the names with the words "PHONE" or "CALL" - as in "phone steve young" or "call johnston".

For help with Julian grammar syntax see 
 * the VoxForge tutorial step 1 at: http://www.voxforge.org/home/dev/acousticmodels/linux/create/htkjulius/tutorial/data-prep/step-1; or
 * the Julian grammar tutorial on the Julius web site at: http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en/grammar.html.

If you want to add more words to your grammar, you can only use the words (and phones) contained in the VoxForge Dictionary - see http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/builds to download the latest version.  This was the dictionary used to train the acoustic model you are using.  If you want to use words that are not included in this dictionary, you will likely need to recompile the acoustic model with audio that uses the words you want to add.  The VoxForge how-to and tutorial can walk you the steps required to do this, see our web site at: http://www.voxforge.org/home/acousticmodels.

Remember, your recognition quality will be only as good as the Acoustic Model you use, and we need much more GPL transcribed speech audio to create decent quality Acoustic Models.  So please take the time to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thanks,

the VoxForge team.
